## Project Info
The project implements the supply chain smart contract to trace coffee production and distribution to prove fair trade. The smart contract defines four distinct roles in the supply chain and provides access control. The test scripts verify access control. The UI has also been developed to allow for adding the different user EOA to the lists of the different roles. The UI also provides view for anyone to verify the providence of the tracked coffee products.
